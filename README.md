# Revenue Analysis Dashboard
### Providing Insights to the Revenue Team in the Hospitality Domain

## Overview
AtliQ Grands owns multiple five-star hotels across India. They have been in the hospitality industry for the past 20 years. Due to strategic moves from other competitors and ineffective management decision-making, AtliQ Grands is losing its market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category.
As a strategic move, the managing director of AtliQ Grands wanted to incorporate "Business and Data Intelligence" to regain their market share and revenue. However, they do not have an in-house data analytics team to provide these insights. They hired a third-party Data Analyst to provide them with insights from their historical data.
The Data Analyst received sample data to analyze and extract insights. Below is the list of data assets provided:
- dim_date
- dim_hotels
- dim_rooms
- fact_aggregated_bookings
- fact_bookings
- meta_data_hospitality
